## 🧠 Approach

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Performed an initial analysis to understand the data distribution and identify missing values or outliers.
- Visualized key insights to guide feature engineering.

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Implemented techniques such as **[list your techniques: normalization, encoding categorical variables, etc.]** to enhance the data quality.

### 3. Model Building
- Built multiple models, including:
  - **Baseline Model:** [Specify model]
  - **Advanced Models:** [Specify model(s)]
- Utilized techniques such as hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to optimize performance.

### 4. Evaluation
- Evaluated models using metrics like **[list metrics, e.g., accuracy, RMSE, etc.]**.
- Compared results to identify the best-performing model.
